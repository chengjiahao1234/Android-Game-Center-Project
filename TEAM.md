Meeting 3 note:

    - we will change our scoreboard structure to implement strategy design pattern
    - we will write three class of different scores that implements a interface of score and use generic to compare the score in scoreboard

Meeting 4 notes:

    - we discussed how to implement save and load used for userManager and scoreBoardManager
    - we decided to implement a general interface that each java class can implement in order to load and save the desired object
    - we believe using a adapter design pattern for save and load is a good design and follows the open close principle
